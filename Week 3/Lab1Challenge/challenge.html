<title>JavaScript Lab 1 - Challenge</title>

Write a script that starts with two variables: hours and wage. 

Then write the code to log the total paycheck based on the hours worked and the wage ($ per hour). If the hours worked is over 40, give 150% pay for the extra hours worked. Try running it with a few different values for hours and wage. Here are some examplesâ€¦

wage hours pay
10 20 200
10 40 400
10 50 550
12 60 840

Next, if this person got the same paycheck every week, count how many weeks it would take
them to earn $1,000,000. Give the answer as a whole number. For example, with wage=10 and
hours=50 it would take 1819 weeks.
